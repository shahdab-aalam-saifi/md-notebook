# Definition

**Planning** is the process of thinking about the activities required to achieve a desired goal.

# Why?

1. It helps us to identify our goals clearly.
2. It helps us make sure that we all understand our goal and what we need to do to reach it by involving everyone in the planning process.
3. It makes us all work in a goal-oriented way rather than in a loose or ad-hoc way where we just respond to issues and crises with no clear plan or goal.
4. Planning helps us see in advance those things that can help us achieve our goal and those things that can prevent us from achieving our goal and work out what to do about them.
5. Planning helps us to be accountable for what we do.
6. Planning helps us decide how best to use our resources (people, time, money, information, equipment) so that they make the most significant contribution to achieving our goal.
7. Planning lays the basis for us to assess and evaluate our achievements effectively.

# How?

![How to make a plan in 5 steps üó∫](https://assets.website-files.com/5cb90b63adbd7da37ea60e30/5f77ac88f133fa056efb6acd_how%20to%20make%20a%20plan%20in%205%20steps.jpg)

1. Define your goal in writing

   Making an effective action plan starts with defining and documenting the end goal. Beyond increasing the odds of success, putting your goals in writing will also force you to consider the process required‚Äînot just the desired outcome. This is especially helpful when trying to define goals that might be vague, lofty, or unformed.

   SMART is an acronym. A SMART goal is smart because it is:

   - **S**pecific
   - **M**easurable
   - **A**chievable (but ambitious)
   - **R**elevant (and realistic)
   - **T**ime-bound (or timely)

   **Simple (not smart) professional goals: üòï**

   - Get to know colleagues on other teams
   - [Run more effective meetings](https://www.hugo.team/blog/effective-meetings-strategy)
   - Refine cold calling strategy
   - Come up with content ideas
   - Update knowledge base

   **SMART professional goals: üë©üéì**

   - Eat lunch in the common dining area 2x per week
   - Define the purpose of every meeting before committing
   - Review all cold calls that led to a sale before the end of the quarter
   - Conduct a content audit to identify gaps by the end of the week
   - Write or update two knowledgebase articles every week

   **Simple (not smart) personal goals: üòï**

   - Get in shape
   - Save money
   - Get a new job
   - Eat healthier
   - Get out more

   **SMART personal goals: üë©üéì**

   - Work out at least 3x per week
   - Transfer 10% of every paycheck to a savings account
   - Spend at least two hours per week looking for and applying to opportunities
   - Prepare vegetable side-dishes for dinner every night
   - Arrange at least 2 social outings per month

2. Divide the goal into milestones

   Big goals are often so intimidating that people quit before giving their best effort.

   By focusing too much on the desired outcome, they wind up feeling stuck when it‚Äôs time to define how they plan to achieve it.

   But breaking a goal into discrete milestones helps the goal-setter worry less about the finish line and instead, treat each mini-goal as a necessary step towards realizing their plan.

   When you have a roadmap that details what needs to happen, you‚Äôre more likely to stay motivated and committed throughout the process.

3. Identify the resources needed

   Any action plan that doesn‚Äôt account for resources is akin to a wishlist.

   Whether you‚Äôre embarking on a solo project or working as a team, identifying the resources needed to successfully act on your plan will enable you to make informed decisions regarding its implementation.

   Here are a few examples of resources you might identify in an action plan:

- **People or knowledge resources**: A marketing manager with the goal of driving more organic traffic will need people (namely, writers) to help execute the plan. An entrepreneur in need of a website will need someone (namely, a web designer) to set it up.
- **Technology and software resources**: A marketing manager with the goal of getting more leads might need a new tool to run display ads. An IT director who needs to install a new phone system will need to select a provider.
- **Financial or time resources**: You‚Äôll probably invest both time and money into accomplishing your plan. Include estimates for both in your action plan even if your financial cost is minimal.

4. Prioritize and assign all related tasks

   Different goals can benefit from different types of planning.

   If you‚Äôre planning a new initiative, you might start by identifying where you are currently in relation to where you‚Äôd like to be.

   If you‚Äôre solving an existing problem, you might [use brainstorming](https://www.hugo.team/blog/better-brainstorming) to analyze the situation and explore potential solutions.

   In either case, your action plan is more actionable when you prioritize each [task](https://www.hugo.team/blog/meeting-tasks-and-action-items).

   If you‚Äôre flying solo, prioritization will rely solely on effort and impact. When working in a group, you‚Äôll need to both prioritize and assign tasks to track progress and inject accountability.

5. Review, reflect, and refine as you go

   Creating an action plan is important, but remaining agile is crucial to success in the long-term.

   An effective action plan isn‚Äôt static‚Äîit‚Äôs dynamic and subject to evolve as your organization and circumstances inevitably change.

   The best way to ensure your plan of action is still sound is to regularly review the plan. An ongoing review enables you to not only track progress against each task or mini-goal, it also empowers you to make necessary changes to meet the growing needs of your team or organization.

# Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that can be used for any task. For many people, time is an enemy. The anxiety triggered by ‚Äúthe ticking clock‚Äù, especially when it involves a deadline, leads to ineffective work and study habits which in turn lead to procrastination.

The aim of the Pomodoro Technique is to use time as a valuable ally in accomplishing what we want to do in the way we want to do it, and to enable us to improve continually the way we work or study.

At the beginning of each day select the tasks you need to complete and put them on the TODO list above.

Start working:

1. Start the Pomodoro timer
2. Work until the Pomodoro rings
3. Take a short break (3-5 minutes)

Keep on working, Pomodoro after Pomodoro, until the task at hand is finished. Every 4 Pomodoros take a longer break, (15‚Äì30 minutes).

# Importance of Planning

1. Planning facilitates management by objectives.
2. Planning minimizes uncertainties.
3. Planning facilitates co-ordination.
4. Planning facilitates controlling.
5. Planning encourages innovations.

# The results of poor planning

## 1. Poor time management

Poor planning means that the schedule that the team members are supposed to follow is not set out. The members will have no clear picture of what is expected of them as they work on the projects. There will be no deadlines to meet hence creating a lazy atmosphere among the team members. This means that the [project](http://faculty.usfsp.edu/gkearns/Articles2/PM in the IS and IT Industries.pdf) will not be completed on time and the result will be a shoddily done work.

## 2. Poor clear definitions of project‚Äôs objectives

The aim of the project is set out at the onset of planning for the project. Therefore, if the planning is not at done right, the [team](http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/h07-105#.V1R7MCE7TIU) members will not know what exactly they are working on and this will make them not to work efficiently for the project. Their productivity and output will be very low, leading to the failure of the project.

## 3. Lack of support from stakeholders

The stakeholders usually have expectations from a presentation of the plan of the project to be worked on. If the planning is poor, the stakeholders will not support the project as they will have different expectations, which will be negative. People who intended to sponsor the project may not do so because they do not have a clear picture of what they are sponsoring.

## 4. Failing to plan exposes the project to unpredicted high risks and problems

This leads to time wastage in trying to figure out how to solve the challenges that the project faces. Time is money hence the funds of the project will be used in solving the issues that arise from the project due to poor planning. Subsequently, the project will be destined for failure.
The people assigned to do various tasks on the project may not be the ones suitable for that because the planning was poorly done. This limits the members from fully exploiting their full potential hence the project fails.
